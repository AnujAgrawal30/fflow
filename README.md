### Become a Financial Flow Ninja!

**An entry for the Formula 0001: Rapyd Fintech Grand Prix**

With ‚ù§ From Milan üçï, By Eng. Domingo Lupo

## What it is?
FFlow.ninja is a visual editor for creating financial flows. 
It works by dragging and dropping blocks and then connecting them to create 
a business logic, by describing the process rather than coding it.

## Why?
Working for almost a decade in fintech I realize that no financial flow 
in the early stages of design is made by developers, instead is 
conceptualize by non-technical profiles, like business people, marketing, 
sales, etc. After the business logic is set, then developers translate 
*the idea* into code.

FFlow works by converting *the idea* into an application without having 
to write code relying on Visual Scripting and the Rapyd API.
